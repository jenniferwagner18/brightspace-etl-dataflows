# ETL Data Flows for Brightspace by D2L Data Sets

These pages include steps to create ETL data flows in Domo Analytics using Brightspace by D2L data sets. The reports available to instructors within D2L do not always include enough data or are tedious to download, or an export function does not exist yet, such as for Mastery View of learning outcomes. With access to the data sets in Domo Analytics (via Insights Report Builder, previously called Self-Serve Analytics), admins can use Magic ETL to extract the requested data and download it as Excel or CSV files. No knowledge of SQL is required.
