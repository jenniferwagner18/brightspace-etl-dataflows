# ETL Data Flows for D2L Brightspace Data Sets

These pages include steps to create ETL data flows in Domo Analytics using Brightspace by D2L data sets. The reports available to instructors within D2L do not always include enough data or are tedious to download, or an export function does not exist yet, such as for Mastery View of learning outcomes. With access to the data sets in Domo Analytics (via Insights Report Builder), admins can use Magic ETL to extract the requested data and download it as Excel or CSV files. No knowledge of SQL is required.

Update: D2L Brightspace is transitioning from Domo to Quicksight in 2024. Not all of the ETL features found in Domo are available in Quicksight, so I will be adding SQL code to the [D2L Brightspace SQL repository](https://github.com/jenniferwagner18/d2l-brightspace-sql).
